# HR13-First-Timers-Track

## Track Description
Discord is an instant messaging platform that quickly evolved into a general communications app with hundreds of millions of users. One of the main features of Discord is the ability to add “bots” to servers – collections of persistent text and voice channels – that can provide utilities ranging from moderation assistance to implementations of simple games.
## Prompt
For this track, you will be tasked with creating a Discord bot that performs any kind of functionality you want – be creative! the more fun and/or useful the better! Since this track is for first-timers, usage of the starter code provided during the workshop is allowed.
